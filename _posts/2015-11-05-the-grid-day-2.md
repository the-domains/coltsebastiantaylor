I'm not completely sold on this system just yet.  Then again, I fully realize that perhaps I'm not comprehending how this is suppose to work. I have a temporary site [www.coltsebastiantaylor.com][0].  Overall I like the set up of that particular site, I would just really like to use this system for post creation.
