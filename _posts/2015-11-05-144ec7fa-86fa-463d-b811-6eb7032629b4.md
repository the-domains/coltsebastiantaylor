And then one day, I got in.

The Grid. The future of website design? Perhaps. I first saw The Grid last year and was immediately intrigued. My Pith Helmet off to the folks in marketing, they certainly sucked me in. I became a founding member on October 14th, 2014\. After that I waited. I was hoping to get access in early spring. Early spring became late spring. Late spring became early summer. Early summer became, well, November. 

Needless to say I became a bit discontent with the communication and pace of development. So much so, I decided to make two videos questioning where The Grid was.

I was going to make one every few months, but I got sidetracked with other adventures.

However today, November 14th 2015, I got my invite. I got in.

My initial thoughts? 

This seems like a very expensive blogging site rather than a website builder. As someone who films a lot of adventures, it would be nice to embed some videos or display them somehow. If Facebook and Twitter can preview videos, surely the web wizards here can. I do recall them touting some sort of eCommerce system. I guess that is on the drawing board right now also.  

We shall see.  

The Adventure continues friends.
