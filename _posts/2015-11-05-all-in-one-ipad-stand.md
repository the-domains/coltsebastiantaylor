The[All In One iPad Stand][0]is a great place to rest your iPad and other electronic devices while they are charging. Officially, it is designed to be on your nightstand, but I think it is far more effective being on your desk at work or in a home office. It seems to be made of very durable plastic, so it'll last quite a while as you drop in your iPhone, keys, and whatever else you need to store near your electronic devices.

This video is one of the first videos to be filmed in my official "Colt Studios." There is still some work to be done, but many videos will be filmed at this location from now on. In the after credits scene you see me watching the[after credits scene][1]from another video that references a[previous video][2]. I'm sure in a year or so there will be a casual reference to this video.
